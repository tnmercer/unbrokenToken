# Unbroken Token (UBT)

New token creation 
* Solidity & remix
* Hardcode initial supply, name and code


ICO
* Explore different launch strategies
    * Launch price graduates by batch
    * Launch price graduates by time


Streamlit App
* Countdown? 
* Pool size display? 
* Purchase and sale functions
* Details of ICO and strategy status, e.g. "50,000 coins left at X eth, the next price will be Y" (or whichever strategy is used)


Basis of Token - The gambling game
* Strategy similar to UK premium bonds (but much riskier!)
    * purchase a token (acts like an ticket) with eth
    * receive a token of UBT
    * eth collected in a central account and staked 
    * earnings from staking paid into central account
    * each month (day/week?) the earnings in central account are paid out to random 5% (+-) of UBT token holders
